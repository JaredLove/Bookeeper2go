        <p>We log on to your computer during a phone call with you, and review the entries, chart of accounts, <br>
         bank reconciliations, etc., as well as examine profitability to determine whether or not you are paying <br>

          or quarterly based on your needs, and typically take an hour or less. We feel that this is a crucial service <br>
